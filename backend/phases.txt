Phase 1: Database Design and Management
Schema Design: Focus on designing the database schema for the core entities: Users, Buildings, Apartments, Applications, etc.
Define relationships (e.g., Users apply for Apartments, Apartments belong to Buildings).
Use tools like ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) to plan the structure.
Database Operations: Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all entities and optimize queries with indexes for performance.

Phase 2: Authentication and Authorization System
User Registration & Login: Set up the authentication flow using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement roles for Client users and Brokerage users, each with specific access privileges.

Phase 3: Backend API Development
API Endpoints: Build RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on Users, Apartments, Buildings, and Applications.
Middleware for Authentication & Authorization: Integrate middleware to secure endpoints with authentication checks (JWT tokens) and role checks (RBAC).

Phase 4: Frontend Development - Core Components
UI Components: Start with building the general UI elements: Navigation bars, forms for login/register, and modals for apartment details.
Client-Side Features: Implement search, filter functionality, and display for apartment listings. Add features like favorites/watchlist for 
Phase 5: Application System for Rentals or Purchases
Application Process: Design and build the application submission form for rental/purchase. Let users upload necessary documents (ID, bank statements, etc.) and track the status of their application.

Phase 6: File and Image Management
Image & Document Uploads: Integrate with Cloudinary for managing image uploads and document storage for the application process.
Document Management: Allow Brokerage users to review, approve, and request additional documents as needed.

Phase 7: Brokerage Dashboard
Management Features: Develop a dashboard where Brokerage users can manage their apartment listings, review applications, and process appointments.
Calendar Integration: Display scheduled appointments and let brokers update the status of each appointment (e.g., "Done").

Phase 8: User Interaction Features
Messaging System: Implement a messaging system for communication between Client users and brokers.
Virtual Tours & Tools: Integrate 3D virtual tours (e.g., Matterport) for apartment listings. Provide tools for comparison and scheduling viewings.

Phase 9: Analytics and Reporting
Brokerage Analytics Dashboard: Add features to help brokers track applications, view property trends, and generate reports on activities.

Phase 10: Security Implementation
Data Encryption & Input Validation: Implement security best practices like encrypting sensitive data (passwords, documents) and validating user inputs to prevent attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

Phase 11: Testing
Testing: Start writing unit tests for backend logic and integration tests for API endpoints. Later, write end-to-end tests to ensure the entire workflow functions as expected.

Phase 12: Deployment and DevOps
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up automated deployment workflows and integrate continuous testing. Focus on scaling, server configuration, and optimizing performance.
Phase 13: External Integrations
Payment Gateways & Maps: Set up payment gateways for rent or application fees. Integrate map services for location-based features and weather data for property insights.

Phase 14: Documentation
API Documentation: Document the API endpoints, request/response structure, and expected inputs.
User Guides: Prepare user guides for both client and brokerage interfaces, explaining how to use the system.
